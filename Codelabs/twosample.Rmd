<p style="text-align:justify;"> In the year 2009, each student in a random sample of 6 Bsc. Statistics students in xyz University was asked about their salary package after they completed graduation. In the year 2015, the same question was asked to another sample of 6 students, graduating from the same course.
Test to see whether the mean salary offered after graduation has changed over the past 6
years, 95% level of significance </p> 
<br><center>batch2009 : 567, 759, 1029, 400, 998, 936</center>
<br><center>batch2015 : 820, 960, 700, 545, 769, 1001 </center><br>

<h5>Execution in R</h5>

```{r}
## load the library required to intergrate R and Python
library(reticulate)
```

```{python,comment=NA}

## Load the python libraries
from scipy.stats import ttest_1samp
from scipy.stats import ttest_ind
 
##ttest_1samp: used for carrying out one sample t-tests
##ttest_ind: used for carrying out two sample independent t-tests


```

```{r ,comment=NA}

## Generate a vector of values
batch2009 <- c(567, 759, 1029, 400, 998, 936)
batch2015 <-c(820, 960, 700, 545, 769, 1001)

## Test for unequal variances
var.test(batch2009,batch2015)#p-value = 0.3878, so we fail to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the variances are approximately equal

## Carry out the two sample t-test 
t.test(batch2009,batch2015,alternative = "two.sided",var.equal = TRUE)


```


<h5>Execution in Python</h5>
<br>
```{python,comment=NA}

## Generate a vector of values
batch2009 = [567, 759, 1029, 400, 998, 936]
batch2015 =[820, 960, 700, 545, 769, 1001]

## Carry out the two sample t-test 
ttest_ind(batch2009, batch2015, equal_var = True)

```

<center><strong><h4>Example 2</h4></strong></center>

<p style="text-align:justify;"> Dr.Smith is teaching two sections of statistics, with 15 and 19 students respectively. The grades on an exam are as follows. </p> 
<center>Section 1: 100,95,90,90,90,90,85,83,80,79,71,71,70,66,48</center>
<center>Section 2: 100,100,100,100,98,98,98,93,93,90,86,83,81,79,79,76,61,48,41</center>

<p style="text-align:justify;"> One of the classes asks if they did significantly better or worse on the exam than the other class. Using an alpha level= 0.10, what should Smith tell them?</p>

<h5>Execution in R</h5>
<br>
```{r ,comment=NA}

## Generate a vector of values

Section1 <- c(100,95,90,90,90,90,85,83,80,79,71,71,70,66,48)
Section2 <- c(100,100,100,100,98,98,98,93,93,90,86,83,81,79,79,76,61,48,41)

## Test for unequal variances
var.test(Section1,Section2)#p-value = 0.308, so we fail to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the variances are approximately equal

## Carry out the two sample t-test
t.test(Section1,Section2,alternative = "two.sided",var.equal = TRUE)
